# Sensors
## Calendar Sensor
The status of the calendar sensor indicates (on/off) whether there is an event on at the current time. The `message`, `all_day`, `start_time`, `end_time`, `location` and `description` attributes provide details of the current or next event. A non-all-day event is favoured over all_day events. To act a set time before or after an event, use a [calendar trigger](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/calendar/#automation) with an `offset`.

The `data` attribute provides an array of events for the period defined by the `start_offset` and `end_offset` in `ms365_calendars_<entity_name>.yaml`. Individual array elements can be accessed using the template notation `states.calendar.<entity_name>_calendar.attributes.data[0...n]`.

### Location details

`location` is the name of the place, as Outlook shows it. When MS Graph knows more about the place, such as for an address picked from the suggestions in Outlook or for a booked room, `location_details` has it, with only the parts that are filled in:

- `address` - `street`, `city`, `state`, `postal_code` and `country`
- `coordinates` - `latitude` and `longitude`
- `type` - the kind of place, such as `conference_room`, `street_address`, `business_address` or `local_business`. A place typed in as plain text has no type
- `email` - the email address of a room
- `uri` - a link for the place

`location_details` is `null` when there is nothing more than the name.

An event can be held in several places, such as a room and a home office. `location` then has all their names, separated by `; `, and `locations` lists each place with its `name` and the same details. For an event in one place, or none, `locations` is `null`.

```yaml
location: Fourth Coffee
location_details:
  address:
    street: 4567 Main St
    city: Redmond
    state: WA
    postal_code: "98052"
    country: United States
  coordinates:
    latitude: 47.672
    longitude: -122.103
  type: local_business
locations: null
```

```yaml
location: Room 1; Head office
location_details: null
locations:
  - name: Room 1
    type: conference_room
    email: room1@example.com
  - name: Head office
    address:
      street: 1 Station Square
      city: Utrecht
      postal_code: 3511 ED
      country: Netherlands
```

For example, this template gives the address of the first event as one line, such as for a travel time to it. It gives nothing when there is no event in the period, or no address:

{% raw %}
```
{% set events = state_attr('calendar.user_primary', 'data') or [] %}
{% set details = events[0].location_details if events else none %}
{% if details and details.address is defined %}
  {{ details.address.values() | join(', ') }}
{% endif %}
```
{% endraw %}
